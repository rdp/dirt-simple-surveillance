This aims to be a camera surveillance system (open source, cross platform) that is actually
user friendly, and runs on windows.

What it does do:

Saves off a directshow capture device, splitting the video each hour, into its own folder.
Good performance via ffmpeg mpegv4 codec, doesn't hog RAM.  Doesn't use too much disk space.
Does work with various resolutions coming from the camera.


Why?

The existing solutions for windows seemed to totally be cpu and memory hogs (yawcam), or not be
totally open source (iSpy, yawcam).

Also they weren't too user friendly.

TODO

service

nerd instructions
make it possible to be generic, then human instructions

what about VLC instead? Might it "just work"?

distributable
advertise
motion detect
x264?
do I need to be able to specify pin type within ffmpeg dshow?

@ispy: RAM, inability to set ffmpeg preset [possibly...], wmv3 might have been crashing ffmpeg.exe, annoyingly

note the Tee work around

make it so ffmpeg works, so I don't need avisynth at all.

== never ==

can stream it, too

complain at everybody that doesn't handle .grf's right
