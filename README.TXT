= Dirt Simple Surveillance =

This aims to be a camera surveillance system (open source, cross platform) that is actually
user friendly, and runs on windows.

It can record from attached scameras using any supported resolution, and doesn't use much cpu!

Ping me if you are interested in this project, or have any feature requests at all.

Why?

The existing solutions for windows seemed to totally be cpu and memory hogs (yawcam), or not be
totally open source/free  (iSpy, yawcam).

Also they weren't too user friendly.
