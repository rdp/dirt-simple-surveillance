= Dirt Simple Surveillance =

This aims to be a camera surveillance system (open source, cross platform) that is actually
user friendly and easy to use.

It can record from attached cameras using any supported resolution, and doesn't use much cpu!

= Why? =

The existing solutions for windows seemed to totally be cpu and memory hogs (yawcam), or not be
totally open source/free  (iSpy, yawcam).

Also they weren't too user friendly, at least for me.

= Installation =

Download and run the latest installer from here: 
http://code.google.com/p/dirt-simple-usb-surveillance/downloads/list

= Usage =

Basically start it up, click "add" to add some cameras, then click "start recording".

It will create video files in your "My Movies/dirt simple surveillance/date" folder, one every half an hour.

It will delete them if the disk starts to get full (currently hard coded to delete them when the disk reaches 10 GB free).

= feedback =

Ping me with any feature requests/feedback at all, anytime!
