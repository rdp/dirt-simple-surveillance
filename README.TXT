This aims to be a camera surveillance system (open source, cross platform) that is actually
user friendly, and runs on windows.

What it does do:

Saves off a directshow capture device, splitting the video each hour, into its own folder.
Good performance via ffmpeg mpegv4 codec, doesn't hog RAM.  Doesn't use too much disk space.
Does work with various resolutions coming from the camera.

Why?

The existing solutions for windows seemed to totally be cpu and memory hogs (yawcam), or not be
totally open source/free  (iSpy, yawcam).

Also they weren't too user friendly.
