make it possible to be generic, then humanize/propaganda-ize
really all I need is a "normal" and a "view while" version [VLC]

can interrupt it, to be able to preview at least.

when you interrupt it needs to kill ffmpeg

distributable
 
== maybe ==

it should survive a camera being pulled out...

ruby server [sinatra]
  just show them all for now, both cameras :P [can click on it to see larger image/video]  
  inline movie player plz? HTML5 should save me, right?
  can browse by camera, or date
some startup-y thing, maybe MS reboots our boxes?
motion detect ffmpeg filter, I think

disk space re-encode with lower framerate :P ?
 
email on low disk ?

someway to ping online "hey this thing isn't working right now!"
  maybe system tray that emails on failure for now...
  
 "if too dark, ignore frame"?
  but you'd assume this is using "most" of your disk space, so this would be rarely useful
  
disk space -- always keep x days worth [?]
cover flow-ish...

wrap libvlc? prolly not:
it can have a custom (raw/encoded) renderer, though, only raw apparently: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/nVLC.aspx?display=Mobile&fid=1587520&df=90&mpp=10&noise=3&sort=Position&view=Quick&fr=41&prof=True
  I "guess" ffmpeg can do the same thing tho...hmm....how fast is VLC encoding compared to ffmpeg?

ispy is actually usable/user almost friendly tho LOL
  it appears to ingest everything as mjpeg [?] maybe that's just for the on screen display...hmm...
  it seems like MJPEGStream  only comes from a url though...an aforge special, it does all the processing for you, in place of ffmpeg/vlc ok.
  
uPnP for the outer viewable fella
  my site to lookup their external IP
  my site to redirect automagically to whatever's configured...
  password protect somehow?
    apache .htaccess local forwarder LOL
  security later :P
    
  
motion detect use this? http://shotdetect.nonutc.fr/?page_id=5 which wraps ffmpeg?
  ping vlc, why did you change it?

email when out of disk :P

show how much cpu the ffmpeg's are using
system tray
daily jpg email

make it into a windows service
  startup item more like it.
  
a way to "peek" while its running somehow...
  ffmpeg fork to jpeg output?

motion detect
x264?
can stream too
  mjpeg output? hmm


warn on failure
  email
  popup
  red system tray icon
  
specify process priority

can specify zones
  trapezoid
  jruby gui specifier :P
some way to monitor it, like view thw two... maybe fork it to rtp?

gstreamer-rtsp for streaming?
 
hmm...if they want streaming just use VLC, I guess, which probably means I'll have to make my motion detector VLC friendly...
