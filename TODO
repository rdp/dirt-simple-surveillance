make it possible to be generic, then human instructions

gstreamer for streaming?

make it into a windows service

distributable
motion detect
x264?

@ispy: RAM, inability to set ffmpeg preset [possibly...], wmv3 might have been crashing ffmpeg.exe, annoyingly

note the Tee work around

can stream it, too

complain at everybody that doesn't handle .grf's right

warn on failure
  email
  popup
  red system tray icon
  
specify priority
can specify zones
  trapezoid
  jruby gui specifier :P
some way to monitor it, like view thw two... maybe fork it to rtp?
