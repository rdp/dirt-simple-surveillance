report jruby bug forcing us to use '_' [?]
  
real installer
  with bg window...
  
new README/simple website
  toot my own horn :)
    simple, easy to use
	efficient, uses very little cpu compared to other solutions
	keeps out of the way while you use your computer.
	accepts dshow/url's, anything else on demand.
	ugly website with one picture :)
	ML


"fake launch"

= if I ever get serious = 

a prompt saying "ok we're recording now"

start capture should be disabled until you add something LOL.

"show video recordings" shouldn't be enabled if you don't have any

split snapshots off to their own directory or you'll think that's all there is [?]

beta launch with people

submit cnet [?]

delete that one file always too...

SDL out option
  fix it in doze :P

test/work with h264 native input...

== maybe or never ==



add "picture in picture" ability to record several at a time somehow/coordinated picture in picture...

maybe SDL out can be made "reveal the window only if such and such a file exists" or the like...dynamic...
  probably don't need this if "normal" SDL out picture can be made to work...

little picture next to each camera line of latest snapshot :)

some way to select an english name while testing what the new one is since you dont' know which "USB Video Device" is which
  low prio

frame rate dropdown system is "too uhgly" :)

preview option for each camera

specify output codec/options

allow for vcodec copy
  
with motion detect have a low fps optionally going as well always

optional time lapse :)

investigate what "normal" input cards give us in XP...are they all just crossbar dshow?

can "tile" the various streams all together into one output frame...

can overlay an image

send an email on motion detect/allow them to view the stream somehow...
  ustream seems *perfect* for this...

more youtube's of how to do various things...

my own dyndns server LOL
  but ustream...
  
"ftp upload" of snaps, or able to specify a directory for snap, a la dropbox

more status updates "just finished this file..."

Linux version v4l2 uh guess LOL.

OS X version (umm...uh...well...url's we could do easily umm...)

there is some "flutter" in the picture maybe I can get rid of it to saev on file size?

overlay "user specifiable" text

"awesome" motion detection that's not awful to set up like most...

clean up my hacky preview hard thread exit

real good looking website...hmm...at least like yawcam

some type of alerting system/email on change detection, et al.

ask for user feedback

"reveal current video" button per camera...
  or better yet, please fix SDL out...

are still frames mixed in still too confusing? probably...

new icon/splash screen

"show video recordings" shouldn't be enabled if you don't have any

start capture button should be disabled until you add something LOL.

preview capture title window say "NOT RECORDING YET"

SDL out in conjunction seems popular so you can watch it while it's getting started.

rename camera button

minimize to tray?
  button :) with one option "reveal" LOL

start as daemon/daemonize option somehow.
  
bump ffmpeg version...if this one doesn't do pix_fmt ...
  once I care about format
  if it works with vcodec

  vcodec copy?
  
mac version (does mac work with my webcams anyway?)
  just network cams initially

"set pix_fmt options"

re-encode with like 1fps instead of delete

don't be afraid to spend for this project! yes!

some system that "tracks when yours goes offline" (pings?)
  maybe it pings some central server...

system tray
can interrupt it with q, to be able to preview at least.

really all I need is a "normal" and a "view while" version [VLC]

it should survive a camera being pulled out...

it could/should double check that the camera is still present, when starting.

it should not "hang" if graph fails :)
  just the 100% cpu thing
  
motion detect ffmpeg filter, I think
 
options: email on low disk ?

someway to ping online "hey this thing isn't working right now!"
  maybe system tray that emails on failure for now...
  
"if too dark, ignore frame"?
  but you'd assume this is using "most" of your disk space, so this would be rarely useful
  motion detect would be better...
  
disk space -- force keep x days worth [?]
cover flow-ish...
  
uPnP for the outer viewable fella
  my site to lookup their external IP
  my site to redirect automagically to whatever's configured...
  password protect somehow?
    apache .htaccess local forwarder LOL
  security later :P
