new README for humans/simple website
  toot my own horn :)
    simple, easy to use
	efficient, uses very little cpu compared to other solutions
	keeps out of the way while you use your computer.
	accepts dshow/url's, anything else on demand.
	an ugly website with one picture :)

take network input?

"fake launch"
  beta friends
  "real"  

= if I ever get serious/never, high'ish-er at top = 

run javaw after the installer...no console, they use that thing

show image jpegs to let you pick which device more easily

when it minimizes say "recording in the background" (not "running" at least "recording")

make "start" button more noticeable

add specs

remember aliases even after removed...

is my "preview capture end quality" actually accurate even?

"preview capture end quality" popup should wait until ffmpeg exits, then reveal the file...

It should have a huge button "start"

after adding a camera, it should ask "do you want to start recording?" or something like that

warn if it's "already running" and they re-start it...

a youtube showing you how to set it up...

show stats "this many kbps currently, this many total saved, this many total days worth"

it says "unknown publisher" in the installer

there are extra quotes in the OSD

rename ffmpeg.exe to ffmpeg_simple_surveillance and warn if any are up when you start

keep running after they click 'close' accidentally...
	
detect when ffmpeg's die--it means your state should change to "stopped"!

for background start don't show balloon [?]

windows service?

use an older ffmpeg.exe [?]
  or a newer one eventually [?]
  
options
  folder, priority, disk space ... bits per second ("days worth, see other entry")
  
change any error messages that say "ffmpeg" :)

assert they use/have different names for each camera

the interface is too cluttered with multiple cameras

never have a console window [low prio]

add timestamp to the still snaps [yikes ffmpeg...]

add "recent images" to the UI--the images themselves...

only record the jpg's when...the thing is up?

optionally delete recordings on uninstall?

ffmpeg -t 10 -f dshow -pixel_format yuyv422  -framerate 5.0 -s 1280x960 -i video="screen-capture-recorder" -vf "drawtext=fontcolor=white:shadowcolor=black:shadowx=1:shadowy=1:fontfile=vendor/arial.ttf:text=\"%m/%d/%y %Hh %Mm %Ss\""  -t 10 -r 5.0 -vcodec mpeg4 -b:v 500k -f mp4 "C:/Documents and Settings/Melissa/My Documents/My Videos/dirt_simple_surveillance/sideways/2012-12-24/09h-43m.mp4.partial" -updatefirst 1 -r 1/10 "C:/Documents and Settings/Melissa/My Documents/My Videos/dirt_simple_surveillance/sideways/latest.jpg"
  does not just record for 10 seconds...yikes!

tell them it seems to report current time poorly with -r 1/10 out.jpeg [?] it gets way ahead? like 20 s?
  
more user feedback

can make it less grainy... (which is a symptom of not enough light, or so I'm told...)
  ask ffmpeg?
  does this show up in the recordings?
    not too bad :)
	
better windows 7 "group" icon [yikes]

a "photobooth" equivalent :)
  add weird optional effects to it, too :)
  the ideal would be an "inline" image of it for preview, and/or for recording, too! [teeny jpg's might actually not be too much/too expensive, I wonder...]
  
make it so you can record your desktop...umm...like one snap every minute [?] etc.

integrate VAC LOL

make ffplay come up faster
  this may be impossible, maybe show a splash screen...
  
add an exit button, or prompt when they exit...

make it so it works with devices with same name
  it...should...also allow it to record simultaneously from both [possible bug]

can upload to ustream.tv [cuh-razy]

email myself once a week?
  just use wimpy encryption LOL

I think the jpg snapshots cheapen?...

don't show "snapshot" button when it can't actually show one... [?]
  some other buttons need to be 'sensitie'

make remove device work better, no restart

warn when device *disappears* from computer...
  warn when ffmpeg exits early, always...

allow setting bitrate, show it "how many days worth" it plans on being able to add, based on bitrate [?]
  allow setting size to save
  allow setting q value instead of bitrate?

auto adjust bitrate for different incoming sizes?
  
  don't let preview while running
    button awesome notifier :P
	
the "fake pan/zoom"...how does logitech seem to accomplish this, anyway?

hqdn3d to accomodate for all those freaky blips/trees swaying?
  what do others use?

check how much power/%cpu various things use...

cpu benchmark various codecs
  let them choose/decide one?
  mjpeg cpu/size ?

preview *while* record button

"obscure a section" option
  crop a section?

daily email...

SGC add sensitivities.

remove the snapshots button, replace with something...

fix that it doesn't/didn't allow recording from both, same name, simultaneously?  

fix FFmpeg not enumerating right

tell people they may not *want* audio

can "email you when it doesn't record" (google script?)

SMS/MMS/email alerts on motion detected.

test what "8 input" video capture cards are in windows--crossbar?

do crossbar :)

better icons

bucket by month/year?

allow for re-compression instead of deletion [?]
  640x480, 0.5/s ? hmm
  
optional time lapse :)

minimize on hitting the 'x' (or disable it?)

option for how frequently to slice the video files
  possibly hard slice them around noon, anyway?

after doing a recording, high quality compress it optionally?
  
take out some button I never use [?]

give an option for "just save the mjpeg stream, to save cpu!"

query for devices when startup...

icons for whether recording or not

"every so often" jpeg, in the UI, of that camera recently
  snapshots
  every minute snaps LOL
  
beta launch/test with people

submit cnet [?]

screen cast

web page

ask users what they want...

SDL out option
  fix it in doze :P

test/work with h264 native input...

maybe SDL out can be made "reveal the window only if such and such a file exists" or the like...dynamic...
  probably don't need this if "normal" SDL out picture can be made to work...

little picture next to each camera line of latest snapshot :)

with motion detect have a low fps optionally going as well always

can overlay an image

send an email on motion detect/allow them to view the stream somehow...
  ustream seems *perfect* for this...

more youtube's of how to do various things...

my own dyndns server LOL
  but ustream...
  
"ftp upload" of snaps, or able to specify a directory for snap, a la dropbox

more status updates "just finished this file..."

fix ffmpeg dshow 65536 thinger...

allow for streaming through VLC, too?
  with uPnP LOL
  password protect (nginx/apache container/forwarder?)

stream surveillance to justin.tv? youtube?
  
Linux version v4l2 uh guess LOL.

OS X version (umm...uh...well...url's we could do easily umm...)

there is some "flutter" in the picture maybe I can get rid of it to saev on file size?

overlay "user specifiable" text

"awesome" motion detection that's not awful to set up like most...

clean up my hacky preview hard thread exit

real good looking website...hmm...at least like yawcam

some type of alerting system/email on change detection, et al.

ask for user feedback

"reveal current video" button per camera...
  or better yet, please fix SDL out...

new icon/splash screen

"show video recordings" shouldn't be enabled if you don't have any

start capture button should be disabled until you add something LOL.

preview capture title window say "NOT RECORDING YET"

SDL out in conjunction seems popular so you can watch it while it's getting started.

rename camera button

minimize to tray?
  button :) with one option "reveal" LOL

start as daemon/daemonize option somehow.
  
bump ffmpeg version...if this one doesn't do pix_fmt ...
  once I care about format
  if it works with vcodec
  
able to input "-vcodec h264"
  vcodec copy?
  
mac version (does mac work with my webcams anyway?)
  just network cams initially

"set pix_fmt options"

re-encode with like 1fps instead of delete

don't be afraid to spend for this project! yes!

some system that "tracks when yours goes offline" (pings?)
  maybe it pings some central server...

system tray
can interrupt it with q, to be able to preview at least.

really all I need is a "normal" and a "view while" version [VLC]

it should survive a camera being pulled out...

it could/should double check that the camera is still present, when starting.

it should not "hang" if graph fails :)
  just the 100% cpu thing
  
motion detect ffmpeg filter, I think
 
options: email on low disk ?

someway to ping online "hey this thing isn't working right now!"
  maybe system tray that emails on failure for now...
  
"if too dark, ignore frame"?
  but you'd assume this is using "most" of your disk space, so this would be rarely useful
  motion detect would be better...
  
disk space -- force keep x days worth [?]
cover flow-ish...
  
uPnP for the outer viewable fella
  my site to lookup their external IP
  my site to redirect automagically to whatever's configured...
  password protect somehow?
    apache .htaccess local forwarder LOL
  security later :P
    
email when out of disk :P

daily jpg email option

make it into a windows service
  startup item more like it.

warn on failure (camera disappeared/already in use)
  email
  popup
  red system tray icon
  
can specify motion detect zones
  trapezoid
  jruby gui specifier :P
some way to monitor it, like view thw two... maybe fork it to rtp?
