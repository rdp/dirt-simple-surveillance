"keep this many GB"

delete camera

does "stop" just tell it to cut the current vid and go onto the next?
  
better name

installer

option for where to store stuff...trivial directory chooser

fps et al.

== maybe or never ==

are still frames mixed in still too confusing? probably...

new icon/splash screen

"show video recordings" shouldn't be enabled if you don't have any

start capture should be disabled until you add something LOL.

preview capture title window say "NOT RECORDING YET"

kill on "overall closed"?

SDL out in conjunction seems popular so you can watch it while it's getting started.

rename camera

can "just start" without prompting...or maybe as a background "invisible" process?

somehow incorporate "last images" stuff...
  record and view same time somehow? maybe fix sdl out? hmm.

minimize to tray?
  button :) with one option "reveal" LOL

start as daemon/daemonize option somehow.
  
bump ffmpeg version...if this one doesn't do pix_fmt ...
  once I care about format
  
able to input "-vcodec h264"
  vcodec copy?

  just network cams initially

"set pix_fmt options"

re-encode with like 1fps instead of delete

don't be afraid to spend for this project! yes!

some system that "tracks when yours goes offline" (pings?)
  maybe it pings some central server...

system tray
can interrupt it with q, to be able to preview at least.

really all I need is a "normal" and a "view while" version [VLC]

it should survive a camera being pulled out...

it could/should double check that the camera is still present, when starting.

it should not "hang" if graph fails :)

some startup-y thing, maybe MS reboots our boxes?
motion detect ffmpeg filter, I think
 
options: email on low disk ?

someway to ping online "hey this thing isn't working right now!"
  maybe system tray that emails on failure for now...
  
"if too dark, ignore frame"?
  but you'd assume this is using "most" of your disk space, so this would be rarely useful
  motion detect would be better...
  
disk space -- force keep x days worth [?]
cover flow-ish...
  
uPnP for the outer viewable fella
